Flipkart Clone App - HTML and CSS:

Welcome to the Flipkart Clone App project, where we've recreated the look and feel of the Flipkart website using HTML and CSS. This project serves as an intermediate-level example of front-end development and demonstrates how you can replicate the design of a popular e-commerce platform. While it lacks real functionality, it provides a solid foundation for understanding the structure and styling of a modern web application.

Usage:
    The Flipkart Clone App is a static representation of the Flipkart website. It showcases the layout, design, and responsiveness of the Flipkart homepage. While it doesn't have any dynamic functionality, it's a valuable resource for intermediate developers to study and learn about:

    -> HTML structure for complex layouts.
    -> CSS styling, including flexbox and grid layouts.
    -> Responsive design techniques.
    -> Image optimization and use of icons.
    -> Design elements such as navigation bars, banners, and product listings.


Feel free to explore the HTML and CSS files to gain insights into how different sections are structured and styled. This project is an excellent starting 
       point for learning about web design and layout techniques.
